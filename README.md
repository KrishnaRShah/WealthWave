# WealthWave
A financial planning application that introduces and enables Gen-Z to make better financial decisions. Allowing users to track their expenses, manage their budgets, export their data in a common form such as CSV, and provide insights and reports for guidance based on the user's financial goals. This application serves the primary target audience of users between the ages of 15-25 expressing interest in long-lasting financial literacy. Some additional features that we are considering to implement are goal setting, reminders/notifications, authentication, and educational resources, pending time constraints throughout the semester.
